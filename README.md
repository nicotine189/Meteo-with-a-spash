# My first API project : Meteo with a Splash

This is my first web project as part of my training at ADA Tech School. It was done in a group with four people, and our goal was to learn how to work with APIs. I later improved the CSS to make the page more to my liking.

## Features

- Get the meteo of the city you want
- You'll get a specific background to that city


## Installation

To make the page functional, it will be necessary to add your API key (in place of "*** Your API Key ***" in the script.js file).




## Tech Stack

**Langages:** Javascript, HTML, CSS

**API:**
- openweathermap.org
- unsplash.com



## Lessons Learned

One of the complexity was to manage several API (great work on the synchronization).
First lessons of workgroup on a tech project as well.
